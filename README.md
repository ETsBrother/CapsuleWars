This game is a test of finger speed, survival, thinking skills, determination, and planning. One bullet is all it takes to convert the living to the dead, and when there are too many bulletsâ€¦what can you do? You are a single white capsule. Your goal is to shoot all of the red capsules-the enemies- that constantly spawn . The enemies will try to shoot you, but you must not get in the way of the bullets to survive!
